254590,"Theme Park Studio is a powerful suite of tools that allows players to design, build, and experience stunning amusement parks of their own design. Players can build whatever they can imagine, and then share it online for others to experience. <br />
<br />
Theme Park Studio includes Steam Workshop integration. You can now browse through libraries of Parks, Rides, Custom Scenery, and Environments built by the community, without ever leaving the program. There is also a new 'Publish' feature, for uploading your creations directly from Theme Park Studio.<br />
<br />
The 'Enter Park' feature adds a new dimension by allowing players to take a virtual tour of community built parks.  Players can ride coasters, flat rides, Go Karts, and more.  With VR support for Vive, Oculus Rift, and OSVR, the virtual park experience is taken to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
Using our rich toolset, players begin by sculpting their terrain, creating lakes, rivers, and raising knolls and mountains. Next, the opening gate is set and paths are placed with our easy path tools. No staggered or sharp edges here, just smoothly curved pathways procedurally built on the fly. With the click of a button, fences are created, stairs are generated, and trees are procedurally placed. Now it's time to build some rides. Coaster creation is both easy and flexible. Coaster rails can be bent, twisted, and shaped into almost any design imaginable. Add brakes, accelerators, tunnels, or have the coaster scream through a custom mesh, like a volcano. There is virtually no limit to what you can come up with. Prefabricated template pieces are also provided as helpers. Want to add a batwing or cobra roll? Simply click the icon and it will drop right in. All the power combined with all the ease of use.<br />
<br />
Theme Park Studio broke new ground when we unveiled our custom flat ride designer. This unique module allows to design, build, and invent custom rides. Physics can be applied to objects connected by custom joints. Next, animations are applied to these physics objects. Animation properties include, Torque, Force, Dampen Torque, Dampen Force, Position, Rotation, and Scale. With this functionality the number of flat rides you can create with Theme Park Studio is virtually unlimited! If building custom flat rides is not your thing, no problem, simply select from our library of pre-built rides. In just one click, the ride drops right in to your park, with full physics and animation built in.<br />
<br />
Next, fill out your park with restaurants, gift shops, bathrooms, etc.. You can pick from our built in libraries, or download custom meshes and import them for maximum customization. Turn your park into a stunning, picturesque environment with our procedural vegetation libraries. With a simple click drop in trees, hedges, bushes, and flower beds, that subtly sway in the wind. Using our particle effects engine, add fountains, fireworks, smoke, and torches for the final touch. Finally, open the park to guests and watch the peeps tour your park and ride your custom coasters and flat rides. You can also take a first person virtual tour through your park, and experience your own rides. Theme Parks are easily saved and archived. You can upload them to one of the Theme Park Studio coaster exchange sites that will be coming out soon. Theme Park Studio is a product built for the community where players can truly build the amusement park of their dreams.<br />

291070,"Slip is a fast paced side scrolling platformer that utilizes a two-color swap mechanic to allow the player to evade danger. Slip is not for the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color. Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color. <br><br><strong>Game Progression: </strong><br>Slip is split up into 12 levels with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level. Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. <br><br>At the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference between life and death.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Why we run: The story of Slip.</h2>You play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You've always been pretty awesome with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You're a pretty sweet deal. Your nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn't he just swap colors like you? Because he can't. Because he's Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you. He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don't have sidekicks since you're not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn't have foreseen in your wildest dreams that Steve's malice would lead to such a monstrosity as the color purple. And now, it is upon you.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Steam Leaderboards: Keep track of your rank in every level of Slip. (PC only.

Slip is not for the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color. Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color. <br><br><strong>Game Progression: </strong><br>Slip is split up into 12 levels with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level. Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. <br><br>At the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference between life and death.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Why we run: The story of Slip.</h2>You play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You've always been pretty awesome with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You're a pretty sweet deal. Your nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn't he just swap colors like you? Because he can't. Because he's Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you. He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don't have sidekicks since you're not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn't have foreseen in your wildest dreams that Steve's malice would lead to such a monstrosity as the color purple. And now, it is upon you.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Steam Leaderboards: Keep track of your rank in every level of Slip. (PC only.

But their<br>struggles have been forced to a stop because of a new and powerful enemy: Man, a wicked race that wants to take possession of their sacred woodlands in order to exploit all their natural resources. In view of this threat, elves and orcs are forced to agree to a truce and to try stopping the invading forces.<br><br>They draw up a plan to stop humans and their deforestation: to find the stationed troops<br>near wood's region and to beat down their captain. But the region is protected with a magic shield that can't be destroyed by brute force. The only way to get in is to use the Milius stone, a magic stone placed in a cave near the outskirt of the forest, that will transport whoever that touches it to another cave placed near the human region.<br><br>This isn't the only problem; orcs and elves agreed to a truce, but they don't rely on the others' abilities for completing the mission successfully. So they decide to send, on their own, a warrior of each race. Elves send Tinargey (Eternal Fire Star) Arson, a graceful and skillful elf woman, well versed in the ancient secret art of Fire Mastery. Orcs sent Vrok Plunder, a rough berserker armed with a big battle axe, as lethal as his arms, legs, jaws and big hard head.<br><br>Both warriors get into the cave from two different places, and quickly progress to the magic stone, reaching it at the same time. The stone teleports them to the destination cave, but the result is not as expected: the magic travel wasn't prepared for two beings at the same time, and now the man and the fly the orc and the elf woman are fused.<br><br>So, now there is a single body inhabited by two beings, that learns summoning the body of one another as they need.<br><br>Once they get used to their new body, they get into the enemy lands, going through a near<br>deforested wood followed by a village, finding tougher new enemies. After that, they'll go toward the mountains to destroy the sorcerer that shielded their people out of the human territories. Finally, orcs and elves will help our heroes to occupy the castle and finish off the human captain in the highest tower of the palace.<br><br>At the end, the wood is safe again, and orcs and elves can continue happily with their bloody wars, but Arson &amp; Plunder™ are still trapped in the same body, and there's no magic powerful enough in the forest able to undo the spell.

But their<br>struggles have been forced to a stop because of a new and powerful enemy: Man, a wicked race that wants to take possession of their sacred woodlands in order to exploit all their natural resources. In view of this threat, elves and orcs are forced to agree to a truce and to try stopping the invading forces.<br><br>They draw up a plan to stop humans and their deforestation: to find the stationed troops<br>near wood's region and to beat down their captain. But the region is protected with a magic shield that can't be destroyed by brute force. The only way to get in is to use the Milius stone, a magic stone placed in a cave near the outskirt of the forest, that will transport whoever that touches it to another cave placed near the human region.<br><br>This isn't the only problem; orcs and elves agreed to a truce, but they don't rely on the others' abilities for completing the mission successfully. So they decide to send, on their own, a warrior of each race. Elves send Tinargey (Eternal Fire Star) Arson, a graceful and skillful elf woman, well versed in the ancient secret art of Fire Mastery. Orcs sent Vrok Plunder, a rough berserker armed with a big battle axe, as lethal as his arms, legs, jaws and big hard head.<br><br>Both warriors get into the cave from two different places, and quickly progress to the magic stone, reaching it at the same time. The stone teleports them to the destination cave, but the result is not as expected: the magic travel wasn't prepared for two beings at the same time, and now the man and the fly the orc and the elf woman are fused.<br><br>So, now there is a single body inhabited by two beings, that learns summoning the body of one another as they need.<br><br>Once they get used to their new body, they get into the enemy lands, going through a near<br>deforested wood followed by a village, finding tougher new enemies. After that, they'll go toward the mountains to destroy the sorcerer that shielded their people out of the human territories. Finally, orcs and elves will help our heroes to occupy the castle and finish off the human captain in the highest tower of the palace.<br><br>At the end, the wood is safe again, and orcs and elves can continue happily with their bloody wars, but Arson &amp; Plunder™ are still trapped in the same body, and there's no magic powerful enough in the forest able to undo the spell. So, our heroes must leave to a new mission towards the unnamed lands, where it's said that most powerful wizards lives in.<br><br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br>o             Switch your character any time you like in story mode<br>o             2D comic art style<br>o             5 difficulty levels<br>o             Over 25 missions in story mode<br>o             Challenging boss fights","Arson &amp; Plunder is a 2D arcade/beat'em up adventure based on the genre classics of the 90's.

Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">STORY</h2>Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. <br><br>The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Blades and Bullets:</strong> Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition. Become a whirlwind of steel and blood with razor sharp katana, short swords, crescent blades, and hand claws or unleash a hellish symphony of ornate firearms to decimate your enemies.<br><br><strong>Four Player Co-Op:</strong> Battle through the expansive campaign alone or team up as a four-player typhoon of destruction online in campaign co-op mode. Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor, items, and valuable loot from your triumphs.<br><br><strong>Procedural Environments:</strong> The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. <br><br><strong>Brutal Damage System:</strong> Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow a hole right through colossal beasts.<br><br><strong>Custom Upgrade System:</strong> Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects.

To fuel continuous expansion and to quench a thirst for human mastery over its domain, a new source of energy was developed. <br><br>In 2125, corporate giant GENKORP unveiled A2P, a newly discovered energy source, more powerful than anything previous created by man. While touted as completely safe and environmentally friendly, there were those who foresaw the danger of A2P and opposed its development from the beginning. This opposition gave birth to ARKANE, a rebel group bent on stopping GENKORP's plans to develop A2P.<br><br>GENKORP quickly branded ARKANE a terrorist faction and an enemy of all good and upstanding citizens of the world. In control of such a powerful life-giving (and taking) source of energy, GENKORP grew into a massive private military complex, holding the key to life on earth.<br><br>But very quickly A2P’s dark side manifested. Earth’s weather was altered forever, with “natural” disasters ravaging our planet, reshaping it and turning much of the world into what is now simply known as “The Dust”.<br><br>Fierce endless fighting persists between GENKORP and ARKANE. Meanwhile, those that have not aligned with either faction are branded as bandits and outlaws. Loyal to neither GENKORP nor ARKANE, they fight for survival, etching a difficult existence in The Dust.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A post-apocalyptic, turn based, tactical combat and strategy game where you lead your caravan on a quest for revenge.<br><br>In a World saved and destroyed by a new energy source, a quest for revenge will unveil the deepest secret on how it all began to fall apart.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/325790/extras/HEADER-4.png?t=1447363904"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> <strong>Deep turn based tactical combat:</strong> Old school Action Points system, Looting within missions, melee combat and dozens of weapons to choose from and more.<br></li><li> <strong>Limited ammo and resources:</strong> Make every round count and think twice before your shooting spread.<br></li><li> <strong>Destroyable environment:</strong> Destroy cover, walls, cars,  graves, barrels and more and make your own paths, or why not kill an enemy that was passing by.<br></li><li> <strong>Rich story and dialogues:</strong> Linear story with voice over actors.

Sheriff Alex Truman has a peaceful life dealing with lost dogs, trivial disputes, and a few drunks here and there. He should be the happiest lawman in the world. But there's just one small part of him that longs for some excitement, for something that would break the monotony he doesn't even realise is eating him alive.<br><br>One cold November night it seems his unspoken wishes may have been granted when he’s involved in a car accident with a man who appears suddenly in the middle of the road. Alex is fine, but the man ends up in hospital with a broken leg, and several cracked ribs. Nobody knows who this guy is or where he has come from, and to make matters worse, he won’t speak.

I fell in love with YUKIE on my first playthrough and am thrilled to say the game is finally available in English!  <br> An Eternal Winter reigns over the land. Yukiji, a young warrior is determined to end this and avenge his forefathers by slaying the beautiful demon Yukie. A traditional fairytale that seems like it could have just popped out of Japanese folklore. <br>But what makes YUKIE stand out to me among narrative-based games is how well the sum of its parts – such as the art, musical score and writing – fit together so well as a whole, to create the captivating atmosphere of Yukie’s cursed yet beautiful winterland.<br>Apart from the text playing a major role in any story game, it was important for us to preserve the poetic phrasing and classic writing style of the tale. For this we enlisted the help of Timothy Borreson who took great care to keep the essence of the original Japanese text.

I fell in love with YUKIE on my first playthrough and am thrilled to say the game is finally available in English!  <br> An Eternal Winter reigns over the land. Yukiji, a young warrior is determined to end this and avenge his forefathers by slaying the beautiful demon Yukie. A traditional fairytale that seems like it could have just popped out of Japanese folklore. <br>But what makes YUKIE stand out to me among narrative-based games is how well the sum of its parts – such as the art, musical score and writing – fit together so well as a whole, to create the captivating atmosphere of Yukie’s cursed yet beautiful winterland.<br>Apart from the text playing a major role in any story game, it was important for us to preserve the poetic phrasing and classic writing style of the tale. For this we enlisted the help of Timothy Borreson who took great care to keep the essence of the original Japanese text. He has worked on titles such as Brave Frontier, Armored Hunter Gunhound EX, Artifact Adventure and its upcoming sequel Artifact Adventure Gaiden.<br>On their path to revenge the player will encounter wolves, crows and legendary beasts that are hostile towards Yukiji and will have to fight their way out of these situations.

It is all a matter of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and where it stands in relation to its enemies.

For example, if a player activates the War Cry BERSERK, players won’t consume ammo for a limited time - so they’re free to blast away.<br></li><li>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION - Our four heroes are drawn from the main combatants in the European theatre of World War II - Great Britain, USA, Germany and the Soviet Union.

These let players customize the “rules” of a Raid in a buff-debuff way. For example, a Challenge Card might make it so that enemy ammo drops will increase, but at the expense of enemies doing greater damage.

Four prisoners of war – Sterling, Rivet, Kurgan and Wolfgang have been freed by “Mrs. White,” a secret British Intelligence Operative, who needs someone to take down Hitler and his Third Reich once and for all.

Each class has their own highly developed Skill Tree, allowing for various play styles.<br></li><li>WAR CRIES - Each class has its own War Cry - a powerful ability that can be unleashed to buff yourself or the entire team. For example, if a player activates the War Cry BERSERK, players won’t consume ammo for a limited time - so they’re free to blast away.<br></li><li>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION - Our four heroes are drawn from the main combatants in the European theatre of World War II - Great Britain, USA, Germany and the Soviet Union. Each character has their own look with fully customizable uniforms making you stand out on the battlefield.<br></li><li>WEAPON MODIFICATIONS - World War II saw the dawn of a whole lot of new weapons. RAID: World War II allows players to play around with these weapons, upgrade and customize their look and feel with authentic weapon modifications. Players can choose between barrels, stocks, fore grips, optic sights and much more allowing for a vast range of different play styles.<br></li><li>OPERATIONS - RAID: World War II offers players the chance to play through extended adventures by undertaking special missions called Operations. Operations is a chained series of highly-modified Raids, featuring new storylines, including content and challenging objectives. The risks are greater, but so are the rewards!<br></li><li>CHALLENGE CARDS - RAID: World War II introducers a new feature where players can earn and spend special Challenge Cards. These let players customize the “rules” of a Raid in a buff-debuff way. For example, a Challenge Card might make it so that enemy ammo drops will increase, but at the expense of enemies doing greater damage.

424310,"<strong>Blessed Ones: The Magic Wolves</strong> is a silly little fairy tale about wolves (magic ones, obviously) and pigs and adventurers, coming in the form of a Japanese-style RPG focused on strategic turn-based combat and party building. It is goofy, flexible, emergent, and open, in more ways than you might expect! Build your party as you explore rural Sleeping Owl Island, finding treasures, making new friends, saving the day--or just ignoring all the problems and gunning straight for the final boss!<br><br>The story centers on a group of new adventurers, hired by the cutthroat businesspig Higgeldy Piggeldy to rid his property of a tribe of evil Magic Wolves, who banded together from several packs to elect their leader Mayor, and thus the ruler of rural Sleeping Owl Island, putting them in complete control! Everywhere they go there is trouble to be found, usually in the form of a carefully constructed boss encounter to provide an experience unique from every other in the game. The story is broken up into a series of interlocking vignettes, finishing one of which has ramifications for other ones, meaning every route causes the experience to change in unexpected ways. Sleeping Owl Island is loaded with more minor troubles, as well--you can help Mirra become the greatest witch of all by finding a mentor, you can show little Kendra the world's a lot bigger than her tiny town, you can help Emma Wolf learn to change her ways (or not) even late in life, heck, you can even help Higgeldy become a megalomaniacal land baron of the entire island, if your heart's really in the wrong place.<br><br>The game's built in a custom engine, allowing for a huge number of possible skills with both really subtle, nuanced differences, and huge gigantic differences. There's over 140 skills in the game, each with two different possible versions to learn, and each character gets to learn about 27 of them. There are also six unique classes instead of boring stuff like Knight and Thief. Why be a Knight when you can be a grave digging Peacebringer, who can drop half their HP to damage everyone, which increases if using the move kills you? Why be a Thief when you can be an Artificer, and cast your spells from items, saving MP, but also allowing you to fill up your inventory with special items that have unique effects? Why be anything the heck else when you can worship the dead and roll with a bunch of ghosts as a Venerant? Or cook delicious pastries as a Chef? There's no reason.<br><br>Also, you can play a pig named Bernard, or Samuel, or any other weird thing that comes into your head. And one of your characters is a princess! Or she can be. I mean, you don't have to pick either of them.","<strong>Blessed Ones: The Magic Wolves</strong> is a silly little fairy tale about wolves (magic ones, obviously) and pigs and adventurers, coming in the form of a Japanese-style RPG focused on strategic turn-based combat and party building.

Welcome home Amelia, familiar eyes are watching you, and they want to play. <br />
Home alone you can feel them. You can hear their footsteps. You need to move. <br />
You have limited visibility. Light a matchstick to see in the dark. Close your eyes. Listen. They’re behind you. <br />
The time you have is no longer your own. You need to survive. <br />
Start begging for your life. Can you make it? <br />

Gameplay Description:<br />
<br />
You wake up at 1am, woken by strange sounds and stirring shadows. You light matchsticks to help see into the dark, that feels as though it’s engulfing you by the second. The floorboards creak as you walk on them, the silence around you being almost deafening. You call out to someone, but receive no answer.

At the end of 1994, you became a warden of The Pompeii Prison which is located in Black Cloud district. As a warden of a private prison, your responsibilities include making plans about the whole prison and solving inmates’ all kinds of problems such as power supply, waste disposal and prisoners’ need for food, water and accommodation. As a matter of course, the prisoners are concerned about these problems. If the warden doesn’t provide leisure facilities, some prisoners may not focus on their work or even cause terrible acts which lead to riots, jailbreaks or suicides.<br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/466860/extras/壓榨你的囚犯英文.png?t=1554730489"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Build different kinds of workshops to keep your prisoners working hard and earning money from the market.</strong></h2>          You can produce nearly 100 different goods from workshops which include drugs, Gatlin or even RPG. There are six main workshops (clothing, furniture, electric equipment, handcrafts, chemicals and firearms). You can sell those goods at the market and of course clothes and weapons are available for use.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Find the specially skilled prisoners from the government and police database, and make those people work in your prison.</strong></h2>          These professional criminals such as thieves, robbers, hackers, killers, bombers and fighters can undertake some “special missions” for you. Those special tasks include breaking into a bank vault, robbing a jewellery store, kidnapping and blackmailing some wealthy merchants. Tailors, carpenters, technicians, chemistry professors and artists can work in different workshops according to their specialty and you can have them make valuable goods from raw materials. Lawyers, bookkeepers, actors, former police officers, singers, chefs and other “talents” can work in your prison as advisers. They can have negative influences on your prison.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/466860/extras/建立你的帝國英文.png?t=1554730489"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Work as the warden to unlock different projects.

These points can be used to unlock a new project which could be useful to your prison and allows you to make more money.<br>          Prices of goods and materials will change every day. As a warden, you need to find the best moment to buy the materials with the lowest price and sell the goods with most profit.<br><br>          There are also many gangs and criminal organisations in Crist City that will come to you to seek cooperation, trade and even help. When you make friends with some gangs, they may sell you some rare materials or even help you at important time. Obviously, there will be street gunfights between the gangs and some gangs may be eliminated by the others. It requires of your making balance between various gangs to avoid one gang’s domination of the city’s streets. If there is only one gang in the city, it may have a negative impact on your prison.<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/466860/extras/在城市中生活英文.png?t=1554730489"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">You live in the Crist City so try to have a look at every store on the street.</h2><br>You can buy magazines which can increase your skill points and condoms at the grocery or convenience store, but you still need to be careful as there are still venereal diseases and AIDS exist in the game.<br><br>You can change your hairstyle in the barbershop.<br><br>You can eat different kinds of food such as Peking roast duck, cheeseburger, spaghetti, borscht, Japanese sushi and even Chinese snacks at various restaurants in the Crist City.<br><br>You can order a glass of Bourbon in a nightclub or have a bottle of wine.<br><br>You can stay at hotels which could increase your stamina and improve your physical condition.<br><br>Drink a cup of coffee, listen to the Prelude 1007 from Bach’s Cello Suite, enjoy the peace of the life.<br><br>Museums, theatres and aquariums require tickets.

The goal of the game is to drive your little space ship from one end to another, dodging numerous obstacles, solving puzzles, opening new passages with checkpoints and discovering unique game mechanics by yourself.

If the game becomes too hard you can make it easier with your two in-game abilities slow and blink. <br />

Think of the second one as a remix with a few different enemies to make it unique.<br><br><strong> - Forever Abyss</strong> The game selects from over 200 patterns based on what level you're on then assembles you a campaign. Its never the same twice. There are extra enemies, replacement enemies and tweaks to keep things interesting.<br><br><strong> - Daily Campaigns</strong> AquaNimble makes campaigns, one per 24 hours that is the same for every player.<br><br><strong> - Make your own challenge:</strong> You can set your own amount of lives, continues, difficulty and more. The catch is that your score is compensated accordingly.<br><br><strong> - Arcade mode:</strong> This is the standard mode you can hop in and play.<br><br><strong> - Six Difficulty Levels:</strong> The two lowest difficulties have slower bullets that fire less frequent. The lowest difficulty &quot;power trip&quot; has 33% less enemies. The highest two difficulties have 33% more enemies. The highest difficulty has enemies that regenerate health and the highest three difficulties give enemies more health. There are more details further down.<br><br><strong> - Differing enemy positions: </strong> Even when you know what's coming, you don't know where. 99% of the enemies outside of the first level are at random coordinates. Random within reason.<br><br><strong> - 30+ weapons</strong> in addition to 20 unique default weapons for each playable vessel. Different weapons do different things. They have different damage, spread and bullets, knock back and one has a spin up time. Flame throwers catch things on fire, boomerang beam comes back to you, spread shot is a wide beam and so much more.<br><br><strong> - Random weapon generator</strong> will make a unique weapon when you get it. Most of the time its pretty standard with one or two beams, but other times its magical. Too bad you'll only see it once since its made up of around 30 variables.<br><br><strong> - Power up and down your weapons</strong> The + power up adds an extra beam to your gun, up to seven. The catch is that it fires a tad bit slower. The - will remove a beam down to one beam, but your weapon now does more damage. On top of those two, you add fire to your weapon.<br><br><strong> - Deeper gameplay that is accessible</strong> Yes indeed, hold the gun to shoot, but if you stop shooting for five seconds, your gun charges to a giga shot. Use the shot and it does a lot more damage than just shooting for 5 seconds. of course it depends what weapon you have and how its powered up. Most vessels have a dash, while others have an anti dash to slow your vessel for tight spaces. You can hold the special ability button to unease a super special... when you're not special enough.<br><br><strong> - Options</strong> When you start or respawn, you have two options with you that fire a wide array of weapons. They also act as shields, but once they're gone, they're gone. Unless that is you die. The choice is yours, have big firepower again at the cost of a life. To protect your options, you can retract them in by holding the dash. If they're retracted, you can't shoot.<br><br><strong> - Around 20 unique playable vessels</strong> are here for you to unlock and enjoy. What do I mean by unique? They each have their own default weapon. On top of that, they have their own special from around 8 specials. They each have their own unique giga shot to balance them out. Some vessels replace their dash with a powerful secondary weapon that can burn out if you never cool them down.<br><br><strong> - Giant bosses</strong> have seven patterns at least. They are so giant that the screen has to zoom out for you to fight them. These seven patterns go in random order. Lower difficulties fight less patterns than the higher difficulties. The top two difficulties fight endurance versions of the bosses that mainly give the bosses four times the health and a huge score to compensate.<br><br><strong> - The specials</strong> Maybe they should be called bombs... they destroy enemies, wipe away bullets, but some of them are different. One special summons healers to help and fight for you. There are still typical bombs, giant clusters of homing torpedo, and some even fire a dragon as a special. Its just one of the ways the vessels feel different.<br><br><strong> - Scores and stats:</strong> Scores are important to some of us, but how does one vessel fair over another? How good at you on this level of a campaign? Everything is kept for you to compare. You will get a score when you have a game over or complete a level.<br><br><strong> - Language support</strong> via .txt files. Anyone can edit them to make their own language file that is s electable in the settings. If there's a language or if you want to make your own &quot;harsh language&quot; script, go for it.<br><br><strong> - Boss Rush</strong> is in so many games, so its in this one. It gets better, because there's a setting to turn off bosses in game or make it only bosses in game. You can select between standard and endurance lengths for boss fights. The endurance gives a boss four times the health, but it also rewards you.<br><br><strong> - A heap of settings</strong> There's music and volume, yes yes. Then there's screen brightness, background brightness, three color different color modes, remove the HUD, view the debug, turn off particles, view incoming enemy warnings. For slower computers (like one I have) there are medium and low quality modes.<br><br><strong> - Pacifist</strong> don't feel like shooting, aiming or hurting anyone? Take on the pacifist challenge where you dodge bullets. To score points you let a bullet graze your vessel. Otherwise the game would get a little dull. Any campaign can be played on pacifist.<br><br><strong> - Bonus levels</strong> are here, but they're nothing too diverse. Collect the fuel, that is all.

Powered by the Unreal Engine 4.</strong></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Overview</strong></h2><br>Hey Guys! Freya is a Cooperative Sci-Fi Survival Shooter.<br><br>...or, you know. It’s just CoD Zombies with shiny blue lights in a cleaner environment with a healthy dash of good 'ol RPG. You shoot stuff, gain levels &amp; money, and use all that stuff to unlock new stuff, then use all that new stuff to shoot bigger stuff. At present, the Alpha 1 just has you shooting stuff while trying not to die. Don't worry, we've got a lot of content incoming ;). <br><br>In each new match, all players start out at level 1, and select a class. You then work together (or complain about not working together) to survive a set of 10 enemy waves. Make it to the end, and you get a big reward, wipe, and players get significantly less. Match Results dictate amount of Rank Progression &amp; Credits your player account receives, which is used to unlock new cosmetics, weapons, attachments, &amp; classes.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Frost Mechanic: </strong></h2>The environment in Freya is cold, and temperature management is an important meta-game to consider when playing. Everything from Enemies, the environment, to equipment and player classes will affect your temperature. If it drops below a terminal point, you instantly die with no ability to revive. At the same time, when effectively managed, players can get performance boosts.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Classes:</strong> </h2>Classes, or Species within Freya, are carefully designed to function very differently compared to other shooters: <br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Agile species will have the unique ability to wallrun <br></li><li>Tank races are immune to fall damage and can break certain environments <br></li><li>Synthetics are nearly invulnerable to conventional damage <br></li><li>While Leader classes are the only ones that play in a 3rd-person for a tactical advantage   </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Maps &amp; Enemies: </strong></h2><br>I originally programmed the map to be procedural, but developing the A.I., I realized a pressing issue. In a procedural map, players too often died of bad luck instead of bad skill. So the number of maps will be limited, design specifically for players to become extremely familiar with, since enemy designs are one of the focal points of Freya's design. <br><br> There are 3 fundamental types of enemies: Normals, Elites, and Bosses. <br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Normals are self-explanatory and function simply as cannon fodder. <br></li><li>Elites are the most diverse, as they possess a single randomized trait, everything from teleportation, invisibility, replication, speed, frost, poisonous, physic, or immunity to certain types of damage. The degree of how powerful these traits are is randomized and determined by match difficulty and number of players within a game. <br></li><li>If that’s not enough for you, that’s when the bosses come in. Not only do they possess abilities that no other enemies have, boss types also inherit multiple traits at once. For example, the Seductress can and will switch your control schemes around to hinder you, but on top of that, you might be unfortunate enough to go against one that is also invisible with the ability to teleport. With all these diverse enemies, the only way to effectively survive would be to balance your gear as well as your team. Which leads us the final and most requested section of Freya. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Flushed Dahlia:</strong></h2><br>Otherwise known as The Den. Flushed Dahlia At the Den, players roll their hard-earned cash for permanent unlocks to everything. Classes, Weapons, Attachments, and of course, the quintessential Cosmetics. I’ll leave it to the community to discover all the details of these drops, but before we end this video. <br><br>There is something very important I have to clarity. It is not the tool that determines prowess, but how you use it. Now putting aside that obvious that’s-what-she-said joke, this means that all weapons within Freya are balanced. Just because a weapon is rare does not mean it is better, it simply means that it is specialized. A specific build with a specific weapon can be extremely powerful, but the same goes for a default weapon in the hands of a skilled player. <br><br> With that said, I highly encourage the community to min-max. I have a rather unique habit of preferring not to nerf. Rather, I find it quite fun to counter certain play-styles with subtle changes in mechanics. ԅ(≖ω≖ԅ)<br><br>Thanks for your time guys!

558110,"Odyssey is a unique science adventure game where you need to navigate across a group of islands in search of a 13-year old girl Kai and her family trapped and waiting to be rescued. The game has an explicit purpose of teaching astronomy and mechanics from the ancient Greeks to Galileo. It does so by taking the player through an intellectual journey as the player is physically navigating through the islands. Gaming is seamlessly integrated with a historical approach to science and storytelling, through Kai's in-game journal from which the player learns the story and the science content, which are needed to solve the puzzles. Players can expect a significant amount of reading. The game is aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards and is ideal for middle school and high school students and for adults who like to read about science.<br><br>&quot;Imaginative and compelling&quot; -- Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Philosophy, MIT<br><br>&quot;An extraordinary step for science education&quot; -- Bryan Brown, Associate Professor of Science Education, Stanford University. <br><br>&quot;An innovative historical approach to teaching science&quot; -- Jonathan Osborne, Professor of Science Education, Stanford University<br><br>&quot;A wonderful 21st century meld of ideas&quot; -- David Mumford,  Fields Medalist, National Medal of Science Winner and Professor Emeritus at Brown and Harvard Universities<br><br><strong>Details: </strong><br><br>Drawn to one of the remote and uninhabited Wretched islands (in the Caribbean) by the distress call of 13- year old Kai, you find that all across the islands are barricades set up by her family, who are expecting a small group of unscrupulous sailors (pirates) to return to haunt them on the islands. At the same time, the family wants to allow rescuers to reach them. So while they expect the barricades to keep away the pirates at least for some time, they hope that a rescuer would be able to get through, with the help of clues planted by Kai inside fragments of text that the player would find scattered across the islands. <br><br>These fragments are pages from her journal that she wrote during her stay on the uninhabited islands, while her archaeologist Dad worked hard to excavate valuable Carib artifacts from the islands. She not only recorded the events that happened in her journal, but also her intellectual journey across 2000 years of astronomy and physics through Socratic dialogues with Dad, and her own observations and experiments guided by those conversations. She and her brother Sid also build a number of physical models as she debates, critiques and argues for her point of view with Dad. All of that is recorded in her journal. <br><br>But after a few unpleasant encounters with some nosy sailors, the last of which leaves the family stranded on the islands with their boat and radio smashed, and only a few days of time given to them to turn in all the valuable artifacts (including treasure) that the sailors believe Dad has found, they decide to plant barricades all over the islands to buy some time, since Dad's graduate students are expected to arrive within a month. To leave them clues about how to solve the puzzles, Kai tears up her journal and plants fragments all over the islands, so that the fragment in each place has clues relevant to the puzzle at that place. <br><br>The puzzles are arranged in a sequence that mirrors the chronological progression of ideas in astronomy and mechanics.

A dynamic front line illustrates the ebb and flow of the conflict.  Pin down your opponent's infantry to gain the advantage and force a retreat, or push through with a perfectly executed plan.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Real-world Setting:</h2>Using the latest version of Eugen’s IRISZOOM engine, players can smoothly zoom from a tactical aerial view all the way down to a single unit, and see 400 different real-world vehicles and units designed with careful historical detail and accuracy. Maps are designed based on actual aerial reconnaissance photos of Normandy in 1944, requiring real-world tactics and strategies to cover and control.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Outplan, Outsmart, Outgun:</h2>From battlegroup customization to troop positioning and maneuvering, winning battles requires cunning and strategy, not just raw firepower. Each unit lost presents a growing tactical disadvantage, and players will need to fight to gain -- and keep -- the upper hand. From commanding historically accurate infantry, tanks, and vehicles, to troop positioning and real-time engagement with the enemy, players will need to be clever and resourceful in order to win. Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory. Whether viewing the entire battle from an aerial perspective, or following a single tank into a firefight, players will need to cleverly manage the dynamic front line in order to execute ambushes and advances.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Steel Division: Normandy 44</strong> is a Tactical Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game, developed by Eugen Systems, the creators of titles like Wargame and R.U.S.E.

583530,"<h1>Running with and without VR</h1><p>This is an application that has been made with Virtual Reality in mind, specifically using OpenVR on the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.  It will run without a headset connected, or via the non-vr launch option, and has control methods added to support non-vr play, but support is not completed and the gamepad tutorial will not be fully applicable. See notes for version 0.95. I've had significant interest in a Non-VR version, so I have been adding support to do this and I'm at a point where people just need to try it.</p><br><h1>Note for HTC Vive users...</h1><p>This application was originally made for the Oculus Rift and Touch controllers, and has been adapted for the HTC Vive, or any compatible headset, through OpenVR.  It should auto-detect Oculus and Vive headsets, and give appropriate instructions.  However, if you are presented with the wrong information, there are launch options in SteamVR and your normal Steam Library to override and force Vive or Oculus VR types if required.</p><br><h1>If you have the Oculus Home version of Aquila ...</h1><p>... then I can issue you with a complimentary key for Aquila on Steam. If anything the simulator runs much smoother in OpenVR, so I can recommend it. Please get in touch.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.  You embody one of three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Columbia, or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with motion controllers!<br><br>Proceeds from this project go towards a major bird of prey centre in Hampshire (UK), where I do voluntary work.

Travel with us through this rift to the year 2042, and take first-person control of Consortium agent Bishop Six on his first official mission. The result is a highly unique, fourth-wall shattering role-playing experience where you essentially play YOURSELF in full control of another human being.<br><br>While the game presents you with a seemingly straightforward mission to rescue hostages, you have complete freedom to approach all situations as you see fit. Decisions are remembered, and can drastically change the outcome of the story. Follow the Consortium mandate and work with your team to accomplish their goals, choose to work directly against them, even fully joining the other side, or skirt the line and play both sides for as long as you can. Both sides have their own truths, and it’s your job to sort them out and decide for yourself who to believe and why. In the middle are a host of characters from all sides of the conflict, each complete with hundreds of lines of dialogue, as well as interconnected backstories and motivations.<br><br>We aim for Consortium: The Tower to become the ultimate sci-fi action immersive simulation.  Absolutely everything in this game has a narrative or world-building explanation behind it, including all of the game mechanics.

Terrorists have seized control of the Churchill Tower Power Facility, located in the center of the 1.5 km high Churchill Tower, and taken all of its civilian employees hostage. The global para-military police agency, The Consortium are being brought in to subdue the terrorists and rescue the hostages, and YOU are the principal agent in charge of the mission.<br><br>In the weeks prior to this incident industrial nanites, the primary workforce behind the construction of vast sections of The Churchill Tower, have mysteriously gone haywire.  The building’s construction was ground to a halt just days before your arrival. Vast sections of the Tower are unfinished and reshaped, making navigating to where the hostages are a serious challenge.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Nanites.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><br><br>Due to the unusual nature of the situation, this highly connected society of 2042 quickly become enamoured by your actions. Within hours billions are glued to their VR-decks, hanging off every move you make. Watch as news reports alter based on your actions, and an ever present “public opinion meter” determines your overall standing in their eyes.<br><br>Besides the specific story unfolding on the tower, the Consortium Universe is extremely vast, encompassing over ten years of development and worldbuilding.

Travel with us through this rift to the year 2042, and take first-person control of Consortium agent Bishop Six on his first official mission. The result is a highly unique, fourth-wall shattering role-playing experience where you essentially play YOURSELF in full control of another human being.<br><br>While the game presents you with a seemingly straightforward mission to rescue hostages, you have complete freedom to approach all situations as you see fit. Decisions are remembered, and can drastically change the outcome of the story. Follow the Consortium mandate and work with your team to accomplish their goals, choose to work directly against them, even fully joining the other side, or skirt the line and play both sides for as long as you can. Both sides have their own truths, and it’s your job to sort them out and decide for yourself who to believe and why. In the middle are a host of characters from all sides of the conflict, each complete with hundreds of lines of dialogue, as well as interconnected backstories and motivations.<br><br>We aim for Consortium: The Tower to become the ultimate sci-fi action immersive simulation.  Absolutely everything in this game has a narrative or world-building explanation behind it, including all of the game mechanics. In other words our goal from the very beginning was to ensure there are no “gamey” elements, allowing for maximum immersion.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><h2 class=""bb_tag"">BACK STORY</h2></h2><br>London, England, December 21st 2042. Terrorists have seized control of the Churchill Tower Power Facility, located in the center of the 1.5 km high Churchill Tower, and taken all of its civilian employees hostage. The global para-military police agency, The Consortium are being brought in to subdue the terrorists and rescue the hostages, and YOU are the principal agent in charge of the mission.<br><br>In the weeks prior to this incident industrial nanites, the primary workforce behind the construction of vast sections of The Churchill Tower, have mysteriously gone haywire.  The building’s construction was ground to a halt just days before your arrival. Vast sections of the Tower are unfinished and reshaped, making navigating to where the hostages are a serious challenge.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Nanites.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><br><br>Due to the unusual nature of the situation, this highly connected society of 2042 quickly become enamoured by your actions. Within hours billions are glued to their VR-decks, hanging off every move you make. Watch as news reports alter based on your actions, and an ever present “public opinion meter” determines your overall standing in their eyes.<br><br>Besides the specific story unfolding on the tower, the Consortium Universe is extremely vast, encompassing over ten years of development and worldbuilding. Every nook and cranny of every character and event has been meticulously planned, and allows for a completely optional rabbit hole to delve into for those looking to get lost in an alternate future from our own.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><h2 class=""bb_tag"">KEY FEATURES</h2></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Play this game entirely on its own or import your universe from CONSORTIUM and continue your story seamlessly! Playing the first game is NOT required to fully understand the narrative.<br></li><li>Imported games include alternate dialogue and situations stemming from your choices in CONSORTIUM.<br></li><li>New Players unfamiliar with CONSORTIUM will also be given unique dialogue and situations based on having NOT played the first game!<br></li><li>Explore hundreds of pages of optional backstory and lore through an in-game Information Console (our version of a codex) <br></li><li>A semi-realtime element allows for events to trigger based on playtime, and for world events outside of The Tower to pop periodically. Keep an eye out on these events, and piece together an interconnected narrative that spans well past the confines of The Tower.</li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Recycling.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>SURVIVE!</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>The Churchill Tower is a highly dangerous environment, with extreme temperatures, security turrets, potentially hostile soldiers, great heights, deadly air vents and more making simple survival a real challenge.<br></li><li>Utilize a classic drag and drop RPG inventory system and manage a wide variety of gear and ammunition that turns you into the world’s ultimate super soldier - a Consortium Bishop. Make deals with combatant squad leaders for better gear, or take them down and loot their bodies.<br></li><li>All of your technology requires Utility Energy to function. Get more Utility Energy by “recycling” dozens of everyday objects scattered throughout the world. Even garbage and litter can yield you vital Utility Energy! If it’s a loose object in the world, it can be recycled.<br></li><li>Find and unlock the Engineering System and gain the ability to upgrade all of your gear to suit your playing style. More than 50 currently available upgrades, with more to come.</li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Talking.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>TALK!</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Choose to talk your way through most of the story, and never even raise your weapon.<br></li><li>Every single NPC found in Consortium: The Tower, including all of the “bad guys,” are there for a narrative reason. You have the choice to try and strike up a conversation with everyone you can find using our realistic, and heavily upgraded waterfall dialog system.<br></li><li>All combatant squad leaders include full backstories along with believable motivations for their actions, and a path toward alliance. You can also speak to the members of the various squads… some may not want to speak with you, but many will and may offer up useful information for your mission.<br></li><li>Non-linear storytelling. Most of the narrative moments can be triggered in any order, and the game will remember what you've done previously and customize your encounters to account for what you've actually done so far in the story. This seamlessly allows for a ridiculous level of replayability.<br></li><li>As of Early Access Alpha 1.0, there is already over 2,500 lines of fully voiced interactive dialog to discover. Our characters are portrayed by top notch voice talent, including Mark Meer (Commander Shepard from the Mass Effect trilogy) as “The Voice”.<br></li><li>Dialog choices truly matter and can cause major changes to occur. Be aware of who you’re talking to, learn their particular biases, and always be careful what you choose to say, or not say!<br></li><li>Forge friendships with individuals and alliances with various factions and decide for yourself who is to be trusted. There is no “right and wrong,” only differing perspectives.<br></li><li>Manage incoming messages and conversation requests from your colleagues and advisors (Consortium or otherwise!) with your Conversation Manager.</li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Combat.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>FIGHT!</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Choose to pit yourself against AI driven mercenaries and soldiers that will flank you, take cover and have a genuine sense of self-preservation - they will surrender to you if they are clearly losing. They can also fall unconscious, but be sure to inject them with incapacitating nanites or they will eventually wake up and re-join the fight! <br></li><li>Battle against a variety of deadly security turrets that are challenging to destroy<br></li><li>Utilize SIX different weapons and a total of TEN different fire-modes with differing tactical value. Your equipment will take damage from incoming fire, so you’ll have to deploy repair nanites to keep your gear in working order.<br></li><li>Multiple lethal and non-lethal solutions to resolving combat. If you want to avoid being kicked from the Consortium, you’ll need to try for non-lethal solutions when you can. <br></li><li>Learn to switch between the Freefall Suit and Battle Utility Suit, and understand the pros and cons to each.<br></li><li>Deep and realistic player damage system. Manage shields and armor to avoid taking any damage. If you let your defenses down you may start bleeding out or incur serious organ damage, meaning you’ll have to deploy expensive medical nanites to stay alive.   </li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Explore.jpg?t=1552177338"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>EXPLORE! </strong>  </h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>You have complete freedom to explore the completely non-linear and interconnected sections of the Churchill Tower as you see fit.

693400,"<h1>Game Over View</h1><p>- A few highlights for the game
The survival map is the main portion of the game. Protect the statue in the center of the village from attackers. There is a total of 21 waves of enemy's. If you find that these are to easy let me know I can increase or change the wave patterns. You have 3 entrances to the village as the waves increase you could be getting attack from all 3 sides. Use your resources sparing-lee. They don't re spawn after you have acquired the resource. You will hear a battle horn that is your warning that you have 3 to 5 minutes before the enemy attack your village. You will hear one more battle horn as the enemy begin to spawn to attack your village. The time in between the attacks start around 5 minutes and increase slowly over time. You can attach your bow to your back by placing your hand to either side of your head and press the grab button on your motion controller. To retrieve your bow do the same but press the trigger button on your motion controller. Arrows can be drawn from your back on right in front of you. You also have a melee holster to attach one melee weapon. Gathering resources requires the pick ax. Get this from your village it is free. So don't go on a long voyage with out it or you wont be able to gather wood or stone.

706880,"<i>Austen Translation</i> is a satirical strategy game set in the world of Jane Austen—a tongue-in-cheek riff on caustic rivalries, appalling preconceptions of the roles of women and men, and, of course, the unending quest to marry well. In <i>Austen Translation</i>, the player takes on the role of an innocent young woman who has to convince a wealthy bachelor to marry her so she can escape a future of poverty and destitution. <br><br>But this isn't your English teacher's Jane Austen.

Each tower features completely different attack behaviors, 3 upgrade levels and individual attribute boosts. The player needs to invest their rewards from winning each game level into researching a deep technology tree to unlock these before they may be used in game. The choice of which technology to research has a direct impact on the strategy options available to the player. Great care is being taken with respect to game balancing such that there is no single super tower.

These combinations provide very high replayability and variability of the same mission.<br></li><li>The campaign is divided into 5 regions each containing 4 sectors to create a total of 20 missions. However the game level layout of each mission is dependent on the blueprint (energy mining platform) which the player researches and deploys for the mission.<br></li><li>Ten types of towers are provided each with 3 upgrade levels. Additionally the third level tower can have its individual attributes such as rotation speed, damage, etc... upgraded individually. All of these upgrades must first be researched in a deep skills tree before they can be used in the game.

The attack behavior of the ten tower types are both different and complementary to each other.<br><br>Once each mission is won you may proceed to the next mission or continue and try survive as many waves as you can.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Game Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Large Scale Procedurally Generated Tower Defense Battles with FPS Quality Visuals.<br></li><li>The main storyline features a campaign of 20 missions which would provide at minimum 15 hours of gameplay. The campaign structure is significant non linear aspects which make each level replayable in multiple different ways.<br></li><li>The enemy waves are procedural generated with randomness for infinite mode gameplay of never ending waves. Additionally when playing the same mission a second time the wave composition will be different. The waves are composed of a total of 25 different types of alien enemy units plus 3 additional units which are spawned by other units. Each type of unit has differences based on speed, hit points, shield, strengths/weaknesses against tower types and special abilities providing for a large multitude of strategies to beat the players towers.<br></li><li>The game features dynamic environments based on: procedurally generated background terrain and weather. Additionally the game level itself is based on a combination of environment and player selected game level layout (blueprint). These combinations provide very high replayability and variability of the same mission.<br></li><li>The campaign is divided into 5 regions each containing 4 sectors to create a total of 20 missions. However the game level layout of each mission is dependent on the blueprint (energy mining platform) which the player researches and deploys for the mission.<br></li><li>Ten types of towers are provided each with 3 upgrade levels. Additionally the third level tower can have its individual attributes such as rotation speed, damage, etc... upgraded individually. All of these upgrades must first be researched in a deep skills tree before they can be used in the game. Each tower type has a unique attack profile allowing the player to build a very wide variety of tower combinations. No tower is superior to others and to win the player must use a range of towers.<br></li><li>Skills, unlock and research tree. The player uses energy gained from winning missions for both unlocking and researching. For the missions each region and sector must be unlocked before they can be played. Each blueprint (game level layout) must be researched before it can be deployed. Each skill such as global skills as well as tower upgrades must be researched before they are available in game.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">System Requirements</h2><br><strong> Absolute Minimum Lowest Spec for lowest graphics quality at 1280 x 720</strong><br>Laptop Video Card: NVidia GTX 620m / AMD Radeon 5570<br>Video Card Memory (VRAM): 1GB or better<br>CPU: Dual Core I3 CPU 2.4 GHZ or better<br>Ram: 4GB or more<br>Note: With this spec launching the game with anything higher than lowest graphics quality will most likely crash the game.

After all, how much fun is researching in the desert? Why not make the cyclops in that region man eating monsters, give them matching robes, and start a cult? And who cares about a benevolent, fair Baron in charge of a town? Ouvbane thinks he should infect him with a lycanthropic disease that’ll turn him and his people into the Grim. The Grim are much more funny!

In the game, you can choose different equipment and weapons and use different kinds of ammunition. While fishing you can charge up your energy gun, and when the king of the ocean is stirred, a huge wave of fish will surge out, after which you can use your assassin’s sword to collect a whole boatful of fish. When you hear the loud call of the giant whale, prepare to face your destiny…<br />
<br />
How to play<br />

821480,"Space Flowers is an intra-galactic tradewars game.  You start with a basic starship at a friendly starbase.  You can buy a variety of different flowers to sell elsewhere and then begin exploring the galaxy looking for other starbases to trade with.  Some are friendly and will trade with you immediately.  Some are hostile and will attack your ship if you enter their systems.  Others are more or less neutral and will react based on your actions.  You can also attack hostile starbases and engage in combat with them to gain experience and valuable items in the debris you salvage from their destroyed ships.  Destroy enough enemy ships and the system will surrender to you and become one of your allies.  You can also peacefully ally with star systems just by trading with them enough.  Every transaction you make with them will raise your influence with them until they eventually ally with you.<br />
<br />
There are also specialty starbases you can find that will sell parts to upgrade your starship.  You can upgrade your engines, weapons, shields, armor and firing control.  As you gain experience, you will find out an alien presence is starting to invade and take over starbases in the galaxy.  You will need to deal with this threat as well.<br />
<br />
You have also learned that your long lost family has been scattered among the stars.  You will be provided clues as to where they are located, and you can choose to search for them as well.  Every member of your lost family is unique and brings an extra bonus that will help you in your mission.  <br />
<br />
The ultimate goal is to ally yourself with every starbase in the galaxy through trade or warfare.  Use skill and cunning to find the most profitable trade routes, deliver specialty goods for additional profits, and accumulate funds to upgrade your ship to advance in rank from a lowly bud to the ultimate Star Flower!  Whether you advance peacefully or through warfare (or a little of both) is entirely up to you.","Space Flowers is an intra-galactic tradewars game.

Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.

Paint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.<br />
Boys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.<br />
School-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.<br />
Those who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.<br />
To make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

894340,"<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one playing</h2>Music at half the volume is playing in the background with different missing instruments. You are in charge of these. If you hit the falling icons at the right time by pressing the right keys, the missing instrument will play. This way you play the song and compose it to its original state.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one spoiling it</h2>If you skip some icons or play them too early or too late, you will play these instruments at the wrong time or not at all and the result will be a mess. Not to mention you probably won’t get to the end this way and will lose the game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one who is god</h2>If you persist and take a while to learn the songs, you will get better. You will find that the feeling from playing them is EPIC! In a real band, you would usually play just one instrument and you would have to spend years learning it. In Beat the Song you only have to learn for a few hours (yes, it will seem difficult at first, if you’ve never played a similar game) and you will find that you can “play” any instrument and a different one at any moment! It’s an incredible feeling that you have to experience yourself.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one who will discover the beauty of music</h2>Should you hear the songs from this game on radio or play them on the internet, you would probably pass them without noticing. As with 99% of the others. But now that you have the option to “play” them, you will discover their spirit, uncover the sounds you would otherwise miss and find that they are beautiful.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one who won’t be understood</h2>When you show the game to somebody or if they watch you playing, then in most cases they won’t get what is going on and what’s so great about it. Maybe it can’t even be described. You have to learn it and play.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Difficulty</h2>Does the game seem too hard? Try different songs at easy difficulty.

This way you play the song and compose it to its original state.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one spoiling it</h2>If you skip some icons or play them too early or too late, you will play these instruments at the wrong time or not at all and the result will be a mess.

You will find that the feeling from playing them is EPIC! In a real band, you would usually play just one instrument and you would have to spend years learning it. In Beat the Song you only have to learn for a few hours (yes, it will seem difficult at first, if you’ve never played a similar game) and you will find that you can “play” any instrument and a different one at any moment! It’s an incredible feeling that you have to experience yourself.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">You are the one who will discover the beauty of music</h2>Should you hear the songs from this game on radio or play them on the internet, you would probably pass them without noticing. As with 99% of the others.

916970,"Duck Casino is a casual shooting game, in which player is a traveler passing a casino. This casino is very strange. It doesn't gamble with money, but the duck. In every game, one who shots more ducks is the winner.<br />
<br />
The game rules seem simple, but vice versus in fact. The whole shooting process is with a certain degree of simulation, featuring recoil reduction, scope drift, stamina, physical strength.<br />
<br />
Ducks will not be sitting ones, and they will fight back against intruders entering the farm. There are several kinds of ducks, each of which has its own characteristics. Some are good at throwing stones at players remotely, while some are good at attacking with paws within a close range, and it is more likely to appear strong ghost ducks at night.<br />
<br />
And the player is not an onlooker who only needs to click the mouse. When a group of ducks attack you, the player must keep moving to avoid the attack, which means that moving will cause more shaking and it is more difficult to aim at the target.<br />
<br />
To get the highest score, it is no harm that the COMBO is high, and if NiceShot is triggered by some conditions, you can get multiple scores and play different ways.<br />
<br />
However, relying on technology is not enough. Don't forget that this is a gamble. Maybe your opponent is lucky enough to hit a very high score, which you have no way to deal with.<br />

-Three modes &amp; playing methods: Gamble mode, Heavy machine gun mode, Duck hunt mode<br />

Our budget for the 2018 game was about $15,000, and the majority of that came from sales from Axis Football 2017. Our small team works on this game during nights (and often early mornings) and weekends, relying on our day jobs to sustain our families and our passion for sim football gaming and the support of the community to continue to improve the Axis Football franchise.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Future of Axis Football</h2>Axis Football has come a long way in three years, but it's certainly not where we want it to be in terms of graphics and depth of features. We made huge strides from last year and have even bigger plans for what we can accomplish next year. Your purchase and support of this game helps to make those plans a reality.

Our budget for the 2018 game was about $15,000, and the majority of that came from sales from Axis Football 2017. Our small team works on this game during nights (and often early mornings) and weekends, relying on our day jobs to sustain our families and our passion for sim football gaming and the support of the community to continue to improve the Axis Football franchise.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Future of Axis Football</h2>Axis Football has come a long way in three years, but it's certainly not where we want it to be in terms of graphics and depth of features. We made huge strides from last year and have even bigger plans for what we can accomplish next year. Your purchase and support of this game helps to make those plans a reality. We heavily reinvest back into the game, and we hope that is evident with the progress we've made. We plan to release annual versions of the game with improvements to graphics, animations, features, and more!

There’s some that I didn’t think would really be involved, and those are the ones that love it the most. The first thing you see when they start playing is a big smile, and it’s amazing to see some of my non-verbal people open up and shine. It’s honestly like magic, and the smile - they can just go on and on and on and on. It is absolutely amazing! One additional great benefit I see is that it surprised many of them that they can do it.  A lot of times they’ve been told what they can’t do, but this interactive music experience makes them feel like they can do anything.  For the short time that they’re doing it, they feel like they have no limitations to what they can do.  The experience is a 10 out of 10, but honestly, it’s priceless.  It really is.  I’ve seen my group open up and smile and shine - there’s no number you can give it, it’s just priceless.”  said  GLORIA Quinn, Assistant Program Manager, Bethany Ranch Home.</p><br><h1>FREE HOLIDAY BUNDLE AVAILABLE NOW</h1><p>Download 3 Free Fun Interactive Holiday Songs to Play with Jam Studio VR - Jingles Bells, Carol of Bells, and Silent Night!<br><br>MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The Jam Studio VR Education &amp; Health Care Edition enables individuals of all ages, skill levels and abilities to have fun composing &amp; performing compelling interactive music in VR while receiving a wide variety of learning, physical, cognitive, social/emotional, communicative, and sensory skills &amp; therapy benefits.

Players are offered a two-tier driving licence where each tier determines which car and taxi tariff are going to be available to the player. At the start of the game, all players are automatically assigned a tier 1 driving licence. This tier allows the player to use non-designated cars only, under the minimum tariff rates. A tier 2 driving licence gives players a wider choice of cars as they can use both non-designated and designated cars, and allows to charge higher tariff rates. To upgrade to a tier 2 licence, the player would need to pass a number of driving tests in the “Practice Driving” mode. Note that where a non-designated car is going to be used along with a tier 2 licence, a minimum tariff will apply. At the customer pick-up point, the estimated fare, distance, and the duration of the drive will be calculated automatically. The required destination point will be shown on the map to assist with planning the best route. This information will be made available to the player before he/she decides whether to accept the hiring. <br>Faults such as collisions, driving very slowly/too fast, driving on red light will attract a penalty deduction from the fare paid.

The player can choose between a number of the pre-defined routes to try and memorise them. During the practice drive, the player will be assisted by a map which will have their chosen route marked with the directional arrows. The system will be capturing and processing the data from the route, such as the driver’s speed and road signs, and will trigger alerts in case of speeding, driving on red light or other driver’s faults. <br>Once in the test, the map with the route shown on it will not be accessible, and penalty points will be given for each driver’s fault.

Players are offered a two-tier driving licence where each tier determines which car and taxi tariff are going to be available to the player. At the start of the game, all players are automatically assigned a tier 1 driving licence. This tier allows the player to use non-designated cars only, under the minimum tariff rates. A tier 2 driving licence gives players a wider choice of cars as they can use both non-designated and designated cars, and allows to charge higher tariff rates. To upgrade to a tier 2 licence, the player would need to pass a number of driving tests in the “Practice Driving” mode. Note that where a non-designated car is going to be used along with a tier 2 licence, a minimum tariff will apply. At the customer pick-up point, the estimated fare, distance, and the duration of the drive will be calculated automatically. The required destination point will be shown on the map to assist with planning the best route. This information will be made available to the player before he/she decides whether to accept the hiring. <br>Faults such as collisions, driving very slowly/too fast, driving on red light will attract a penalty deduction from the fare paid. Memory of the location, effective route planning along with accurate and efficient driving are all the keys to success in this game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Practice Driving</h2><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949810/extras/features3.png?t=1550870563"" ><br><br>The “Practice Driving” mode can be used to learn and practice the routes before taking a test to obtain a tier 2 taxi driving licence. The player can choose between a number of the pre-defined routes to try and memorise them. During the practice drive, the player will be assisted by a map which will have their chosen route marked with the directional arrows. The system will be capturing and processing the data from the route, such as the driver’s speed and road signs, and will trigger alerts in case of speeding, driving on red light or other driver’s faults. <br>Once in the test, the map with the route shown on it will not be accessible, and penalty points will be given for each driver’s fault. To obtain a tier 2 driving licence, the player will need to successfully complete 6 test routes of choice, with no more than 10 penalty points received for any each of them.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Street Racing</h2><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949810/extras/features2.png?t=1550870563"" ><br><br>Fancy a bit of a high-speed challenge? The “Street Racing” mode gives players the opportunity to use and sharpen their race-driving skills. There is a great range of tracks and cars to choose from while the custom-tuned car specs offer a more dynamic and stimulating driving compared with that in other modes of this game. Now, watch out for that bend coming up… <br><br><strong>Happy driving!</strong>",Get yourself behind the wheel of a taxi.
